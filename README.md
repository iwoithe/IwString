# IwString

A custom string type created only for the purpose of learning. Most sane people use `std::string`.

## To Do

- Refactoring/clean up
    - Memory management is currently done throughout the string class, difficult to follow and maintain
- Comment the code to clear up how I've implemented certain algorithms
- Use the Boyerâ€“Moore algorithm for the `find()` method instead of brute force
    - If the length of `findStr` is one character, use a single for-loop
